Search and view sample curl commands for Jamf Pro endpoints gathered from the swagger schema.  

This is a bit of a mess right now, but I'm currently working on cleaning it up and will likely drastically change it.
I'm throwing it here for reference and anyone that wants to check it out.

## How to use it
1. Download bonspiel.py 
2. Run it via python3 ```python3 ~/Downloads/bonspiel-master/bonspiel.py```  
Check -h for usage.  
Example command: ```python3 ~/Downloads/bonspiel-master/bonspiel.py computers```  
Example command with sample: ```python3 ~/Downloads/bonspiel-master/bonspiel.py computers/id -s```
